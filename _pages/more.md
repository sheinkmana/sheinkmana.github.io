### Activity
- March 2023 - Attended [BayesComp](https://bayescomp2023.com). *Levi, Finland*
- Dec 2022 - Took part in the Alan Turing [Data study group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/data-study-group-december-2022) on Deep learning techniques for noise annoyance prediction. *London, UK*
- June 2022 - Attended UoE Centre for Statistics annual [conference](https://centreforstatistics.maths.ed.ac.uk/cfs/events/the-cfs-annual-conference/cfsc-2022) and was one of the organisers of its [satellite event](https://centreforstatistics.maths.ed.ac.uk/cfs/events/the-cfs-annual-conference/cfs-phd-student-day-2022) for PhD students. *Edinburgh, UK*

*I began my PhD in algebraic geometry and non-commutative geometry.  But the PhD path is far from being linear and after the first 1.5 years, I switched to a different topic* (Bayesian statistics and ML!). *Before that transfer, I gave two talks - one at GLAMs https://www.glams.org/2020-cohort/examples-seminar and another on Khovanov homologies at the [Knot homologies reading group](https://sites.google.com/site/psafronov/notes/knot-homology). Now I am happily studying Bayesian statistics and deep learning whilst the research problem I left without an answer was solved by [Patrick Kinnear](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~s1524448/) and his paper [Skein module dimensions of mapping tori of the 2-torus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07332)*
