I am a recent doctoral graduate willing to advance probabilistic machine learning and, more
broadly, artificial intelligence in the age of big data and ever-expanding models. 

During my PhD, I was working under the supervision of [Sara Wade](https://sarawade.owlstown.net) and developed advances in Bayesian deep modelling. Namely, I studied efficient inference schemes with a focus on scalable variational inference algorithms such as stochastic and black box variational inference. My thesis addresses the challenge of architecture specification of Bayesian neural networks, Bayesian model choice and model combination in the realms of big data and overparametrized deep models.
