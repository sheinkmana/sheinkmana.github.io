I am a PhD researcher working under the supervision of [Sara Wade](https://sarawade.owlstown.net).
I aim to develop advances in Bayesian deep modelling. 
Namely, I study efficient inference schemes with a focus on scalable variational inference algorithms such as stochastic and black box variational inference; My work addresses the challenge of architecture specification of Bayesian neural networks, Bayesian model choice and model combination in the realms of big data and overparametrized deep models.
