I am a 4th year PhD student working under the supervision of [Sara Wade](https://sarawade.owlstown.net).
My research aims to develop advances in Bayesian deep modelling. 
Mainly, I focus on efficient inference schemes and appropriate priors' choices for the data-driven design of the model's architecture.
